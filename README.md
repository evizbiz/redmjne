redmjne
=======

JRuby Redmine deployments that are fully self-contained, with and without
customization via plugins and themes in JEE Apache-Tomcat WARs.

Redmjne releases will hopefully keep up-2-date with the latest stable releases 
of all essential runtime elements (as of Nov. 2013):
 
  * Java 7 or later
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.47 -- Websocket support <http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/web-socket-howto.html>
  * JRuby 1.7.6 -- <http://jruby.org> 
  * Redmine 2.3.3 -- <http://www.redmine.org>
  * Rails 3.2.13 -- <http://rubyonrails.org> (evidently Redmine has not yet moved to 4.x)

Apache Tomcat example configs. are included, with and without SSL/HTTPS.
HAProxy and IPTables firewall example configs. are also included to provide
an optional reverse-proxy setup.
