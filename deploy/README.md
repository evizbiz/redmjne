redmjne deployment war
======================
redmjne2.6.2_jruby1.7.19_jvm8.war
JRuby Redmine deployment war for Redmine 2.6.2 using Jruby 1.79 tested with Java 8 via Tomcat 7

This is the most recent (March 2015) build. The Feb. 2015 release of Redmine 3.0.0 
indicated Active Record issues in JRuby, consequently this is the Feb. 2015 
release 2.6.2, with the plugins listed below. The most recent release of redmine-wiki_graphviz_plugin
is lacking due to its github readme assertion that it now only supports 3.0.0 (I tried
it with 2.6.2 and indeed it complained and refused to function!). See
https://github.com/tckz/redmine-wiki_graphviz_plugin

This war is "virgin" with no content and unitialized/configured plugins (only the
admin user with default password "admin").
